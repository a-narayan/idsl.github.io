## Undergraduate Students

Please review funding opportunities listed below and email a copy of your: 

- CV/resume 
- Transcripts

Our undergraduate team members typically have a strong foundation in chemical engineering, process control and mathematics, along with extensive programming skills. Prior experience with computational projects (research, internships, co-op etc.) will be an asset.

### [NSERC USRA](https://students.ubc.ca/career/ubc-experiences/nserc-undergraduate-student-research-awards){:target="_blank"}

The UBC CHBE department typically awards 5-7 USRA fellowships per year to CHBE undergraduates. Awards are competitive and applicants are ranked based on merit and academic performance. If you are applying from a different department or university, please contact your department's [USRA administrators](https://students.ubc.ca/career/ubc-experiences/nserc-undergraduate-student-research-awards){:target="_blank"} for more information.

### [UBC Work Learn International Undergraduate Student Research Award](https://students.ubc.ca/career/campus-experiences/undergraduate-research/work-learn-international-undergraduate-research-awards){:target="_blank"}

The UBC Work Learn IURA is a research award for UBC international students. Please review the [UBC Work Learn website](https://students.ubc.ca/career/campus-experiences/undergraduate-research/work-learn-international-undergraduate-research-awards){:target="_blank"} for research proposal requirements and due dates.

### [UBC Work Learn Program](https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/student-engagement/centre-student-involvement-careers/work-learn){:target="_blank"}

All UBC undergraduate students (domestic and international) are eligible for Work Learn funding to pursue experiential learning opportunities on campus. Please visit the [UBC Work Learn](https://students.ubc.ca/career/ubc-experiences/work-learn-program){:target="_blank"} website for advice on how to leverage Work Learn funding to create your own research opportunities with the DAIS Lab:

> You can create your own Work Learn job by connecting with eligible faculty or staff members and asking them if they might be willing to hire you. Make sure you have a good idea of what you are looking for in a position and try to match it up to a need that you see that a potential supervisor might be willing to hire you to fill. Also, be sure that you know and understand the parameters of the Work Learn program, in particular from the supervisor's perspective, so that you can give this information to your potential supervisor. You and the supervisor would still need to meet all program requirements and meet the same deadlines as other program participants, and the supervisor would need to submit a proposal for funding within the program (note that the proposal timelines for supervisors are very different than the job application timelines for students). This can be a great option for students who can see opportunities for work in areas of campus that may not have considered hiring a Work Learn student in the past.

### [MITACS Globalink](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship){:target="_blank"}

The [Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship){:target="_blank"} is a competitive initiative for international undergraduates from the following countries and regions: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Taiwan, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States. From May to October of each year, top-ranked applicants participate in a 12-week research internship under the supervision of Canadian university faculty members in a variety of academic disciplines, from science, engineering and mathematics to the humanities and social sciences.
