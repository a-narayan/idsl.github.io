## On Refining and Process Control
Two additional papers, in collaboration with the Burnaby Refinery, have been accepted in *Control Engineering Practice* and *Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining*.

[Liang]({% link _profiles/Liang Cao.md %}), with the [Saddler group (UBC)](https://bioenergy.ubc.ca/) and collaborators, worked on novel methodologies for FCC coke burn estimation for lipids co-processing:

- [Determining the amount of 'green' coke generated when co-processing lipids commercially by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) **(Su et al.)**]({% link _papers/2021-su-bio.md %}) - Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining
