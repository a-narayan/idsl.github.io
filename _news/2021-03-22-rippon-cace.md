Abstract
> Data-driven disciplines such as biostatistics and chemometrics are undergoing a
period of transformation propelled by powerful advances in computational hardware,
parallel processing and algorithmic efficiency. Process systems engineering
is positioned for concurrent advances in data-driven sub-disciplines such as modeling,
optimization, control, fault detection and diagnosis. This work embodies
this transformation as it addresses a novel industrial fault detection problem from
both traditional and contemporary approaches to process analytics. Traditional
approaches such as partial least squares are compared with powerful new techniques
inspired by deep representation learning such as convolutional neural networks.
Novel contributions include the formulation and introduction of a novel
industrial predictive classification problem, the design and implementation of a
comprehensive machine learning workflow that converts raw industrial data into
critical operational insights, and the presentation of a robust comparative analysis
between traditional and contemporary approaches to representation learning
and binary classification. Specifically, this work addresses the unexpected loss of
plasma arc in the electric arc furnace of a large-scale metallurgical process. The
objective is to learn an efficient and informative representation from the raw industrial
data that enables the prediction of an arc loss event such that operators can
take corrective actions. A comprehensive representation learning and predictive
classification framework is presented for development of the inferential sensor
from large quantities of historical industrial process data.
