We are looking for a Post Doctoral Fellow to work on an exciting industrial project at the intersection of Control Theory and Machine Learning. 

For details see: [NewPostDocResearchML.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/NewPostDocResearchML.pdf)

Applications are invited for a three-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British
Columbia. The successful candidate will conduct high quality research in machine learning with a
focus on deep learning and reinforcement learning to address real world industrial control
problems. The principal investigators, based in UBCâ€™s Department of Chemical and Biological
Engineering, the Institute of Applied Mathematics, and Honeywell, expect the research to have
a significant influence on industrial practice. UBC and Honeywell have extensive experience in
collaborating on advanced control technology. Previous projects have resulted in a series of
academic innovations and industrial products recognized with awards from IEEE, IFAC, and
NSERC.
