biography: Nathan is a PhD student in applied mathematics at UBC. Prior to moving to Vancouver, he earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in mathematics at Portland State University. He is interested in the interplay between reinforcement learning and control. More specifically, his work aims to develop actionable methods based on deep reinforcement learning for maintenance-free PID control and MPC of industrial processes. Outside of research, he enjoys boardgames and ice skating.
