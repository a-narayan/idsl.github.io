biography: >
  Maricela is a PhD student in Applied Math at UBC. Before coming to UBC, she earned her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mathematics at Portland State University. Her Master’s work involved developing numerical methods for partial differential equations describing the full earthquake cycle. Her current research interests include, scientific machine learning, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. More specifically, she is interested in applications of scientific machine learning, numerical methods, and mathematical modeling to problems in clean energy, in particular to the study and simulation of Li-ion batteries. Prior to becoming a graduate student, Maricela spent some time as a Spanish-language medical interpreter and Argentine tango teacher.
